# This example program is meant to demonstrate errors.
 
# There are some errors in this program, try run the program by pressing F5.

animal_type = "cub"
number_of_teeth = 16

full_spec = f"This is a {animal}. It is a {animal_type} and it has {number_of_teeth} teeth."

print(full_spec)






# Line 6 Lion was not defined as it did not have inverted commas denoting a string.
# Line 10 is a logical error. It prints but the variables are printed in the wrong order. It should be {animal} {animal_type} {number_of_teeth}
# Line 12 is a syntax error as it does not have brackets for the print command.
