1. A protocol is a set of rules and conventions that define how devices on a network should communicate with each other. It specifies the format of the data that is 
transmitted, as well as the rules for sending and receiving that data. 

2. HTTP is built on top of the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that is responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminating 
connections between two devices on a network.

3. If a request is successful, the status code of the response will typically be 200. 200(OK) indicates that the request was successful and that the requested information 
is being returned in the response. 

4. A stateless protocol is a communication protocol in which each request made by a client to a server is independent of any other request. This means that the server does not
retain any information about previous requests made by the client, and each request is treated as a completely new request.

5. The following are valid MIME types: image/jpeg, text/javascript, image/psd and text/calendar.

6. If a server does not allow you permission to request a specific resource, you can expect to receive a status code of 401 (Unauthorized). This status code indicates that 
the request requires authentication, and that the client must provide credentials in order to access the resource.
