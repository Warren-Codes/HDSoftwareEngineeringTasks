        <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>Finance Calculator - Python</h3>
                <p>This project was built with the intention to provide the user with a simple financial<br>
                    calculator. It was built using Python and provides the user with 2 options: choice<br>
                    number one - the user can calculate an investment's value of x amount of years;<br>
                    choice number two - the user can calculate their monthly mortgage repayment.<br></p>

            <h3>Task Manager - Python</h3>
                <p>This project was built with the intention of creating a program for a small business<br>
                    that can help it to manage tasks assigned to each member of the team. It was built<br>
                    using Python and allows the user to register new users and create new tasks that can<br>
                    be assigned to a specific user. The user can choose to view all tasks or view just their<br>
                    own tasks. Tasks can be edited and marked as either complete or incomplete. Extra<br>
                    functionality has been added to the admin user who can choose to view statistics<br>
                    and generate .txt file reports in a user friendly manner.<br></p>
